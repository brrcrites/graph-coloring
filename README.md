# C++ Graph Coloring Package

## Contact

If you have questions or reqeusts about this repository please feel free to [reach out to me about it](mailto:bcrit001@ucr.edu). Also feel free to email me if you open a PR and I seem to be neglecting it.

## Setup

This project has two primary uses:

* As an executable for finding the chromatic number for an input graph (in edge list or edge matrix format)
* As a library for finding the particular coloring of an input graph (represented as a `map<string,vector<string>>` edge list)

In either of these cases, the project requires the use of the [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build system to allow for easy integration into other projects. To generate an executable which can color an input graph file, simply run the following commands from the project root.

```
cmake .
make
```

This will generate a `color` executable which can be used to find the chromatic number of an input graph. You can also test that the system is currently running by executing the `color-test` executable which will also be generated by the above commands.

If you want to use these algortihms as a library for another project that uses CMake, you can add it as [a subproject dependency](https://codingnest.com/basic-cmake-part-2/) to your project. 

## Graph Coloring Library 

**The algorithms hybridLMXRLF and hybridDSATUR are currently broken, see #29**

This system uses a map graph representation as input

    map<string,vector<string> > input_graph;

Each node is a unique string, and maps to a `vector<string>` that represent that node's neighbors. If your system uses a unique hash string you can use that directly, if your nodes are numbered then you can use `std::to_string()` to convert those id's to unique strings directly.

This input graph is then passed to an algorithm object, such as an object for the DSATUR algorithm shown here (Note: there are more algorithms listed below):

    Dsatur* algorithm = new Dsatur(input_graph);

this creates a new DSATUR algorithm object that is loaded with your graph. If you need to update or modify the graph after your algorithm object has been constrcuted, you can do so using the `modify_graph(string, vector<string>)` function.

    vector<string> neighbors = {"Neighbor 1", "Neighbor 2", "Neighbor 3"};
    algorithm->modify_graph("New Node", neighbors);

If the input `string` node already exists in the graph, it will update the neighbors of that node using the input `vector<string>`. If the input `string` node doesn't already exist in the graph it is added to the graph with the list of neighbors input via the `vector<string>`.

You can also replace the entire graph in your algorithm with a new graph by using the `set_graph(map<string, vector<string>>)` function, which will replace the loaded graph with the newly input graph.

Once your algorithm has been loaded with the proper graph, you simply need to call the `color()` function on your algorithm object to color it.

    algorithm->color();

In order to aid in validating the colorings that are created using these algorithms, we also provide a `verify()` function that will perform a full check of the graph to ensure that no two adjacent nodes share the same color.

    algorithm->verify();

Some of the algorithms that are available here are heuristics with variable conditions. While the algorithm objects are constructed with a reasonable default value, you can modifiy the condition variable of any algorithms that have them with a `set_condition(int)` function.
    
    algorithm->set_condition(new_value);

The algorithm object has an internal flag to checking if the graph has been colored, and this flag is reset every time the underlying graph is reset or modified. You should check this flag before you call the `color()` function to make sure that the color map you receive is valid.

    algorithm->is_colored();

Once you have colored your graph, there are a few functions for getting important values:

    algorithm->print_chromatic(); //prints the number of colors required to color your graph
    algorithm->print_coloring(); //prints each node (by name) and it's color (int)
    algorithm->find_max_color(); //returns the highest color (numbered from 0, is equal to the chromatic number - 1)

You can also write the entire graph into a .dot file using the `write_graph(string filename` function, where the file will be named after the input string (if no name is provided it will be named `colored_graph.dot`)

    algorithm->write_graph(string filename); //generates a .dot file named after the input string

This package was refactored to be more easily extended. I encourage you to write new coloring algorithms utilizing this code as a base, and simply ask that you include this repo's LICENSE with any of your code, and cite/acknowledge this repo in any publications. If you do utilize this code in a publication or project, or you would like to contribute a new algorithm please reach out to me (brrcrites@gmail.com).

## Available Algorithms: 

Five coloring algorithms are currently provided in this package (See reference papers for descriptions):

- DSATUR (New Methods to Color the Vertices of a Graph - Brelaz et al.) -- `--algorithm=dsatur`
- MCS (Register Allocation via Coloring of Chordal Graphs - Magno et al.) -- `--algorithm=mcs`
- lmXRLF (Efficient Coloring of a Large Spectrum of Graphs - Kirovski et al.) -- `--algorithm=lmxrlf`
- Hybrid DSATUR (Custom, based on Efficient Coloring... - Kirovski et al.) -- `--hybrid-dsatur`
- Hybrid lmXRLF (Custom, based on Efficient Coloring... - Kirovski et al.) -- `--algorithm=hybrid-lmxrlf`

Additionally, there is a k-coloring algorithm that is accessible, and used internally within other algorithms:

- TabuCol (Using Tabu Search Techniques for Graph Coloring - Hertz et al.) -- `Tabucol`

## Tests:

The system is capable of running tests written in both the edge list (`--format=list` flag) and the edge matrix (`--format=matrix` flag) file format. There is a large number of well known tests saved to the `Tests/` directory, and you can also add tests to the `Tests/` directory. The edge list and edge matrix formats are as follows:

Edge List Input File Format:

    c FILE: <filename.col>
    c SOURCE: <source>
    c DESCRIPTION: <description>

    p edge <|#nodes|> <|#edges|>
    e <source> <sink>

Edge Matrix Input File Format:

    <|#nodes|>
    <|#nodes|x|#nodes| matrix>

    1 indicates an edge between column node and row node
    0 indicates a lack of an edge
